## History

The OFL Programme was set up in collaboration with the funding institution for science and technical research in the Netherlands through an alumnus of The Recess College Sabbatical for senior executives. Its aim was to provide people with some of the benefits of the Sabbatical in an earlier stage of their working lives for a competitive and enduring kick-start in organisational life.

The first group convened in 2012\. The group consisted of Dutch early-stage academics, but since then it has spread internationally amongst different professional backgrounds.

## A unique learning opportunity

Our Future Leaders' experiential programme provides a unique learning opportunity for participants to consider and explore the:

* Choice of the 'self' you wish to be in and beyond work
* Complex differences between role relationships and friendships
* Inner workings of management and leadership of teams
* Dynamics of competition and collaboration; hierarchy and self-reliance
* Understanding of organisations as a whole.

## After the programme

OFL participants across disciplines initiated and developed an alumni group to continue their learning journey. Twice a year they organise events and invite staff from The Recess College to facilitate the learning.

Additionally, several participants have sought in-house training to become peer-facilitators at OFL programmes and events.
