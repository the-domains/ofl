### _**Business, politics, arts, science and commerce need to invest in the future leadership of our world − every bit as much as in those in current positions of seniority.**_

## We need to nurture our future leaders

Our organisations need future leaders who can learn to guide and lead with wisdom, perspective, organisational acumen and a healthy dose of 'political savviness'.

The world of work is contradictory. It sends complex messages of what is required to the fast track entrant and those in the first phases of their career.

Future leaders need to be radical, practical and strategic in knowing what to maintain and what to change from their future positions of power.

## The Recess College offers a 7-day leadership programme

A "living lab" to develop the necessary qualities of good judgement for handling the unpredictability of the future and the uncertainty of other people's reactions. It is intended for young scientists, creatives and professionals who wish to work on their leadership and their understanding of dynamics in organisations.

Participants use the experimental programme to develop their creativity and maturity; to become more ready, perceptive and able in their current position and to better deal with work challenges in their next career steps.

The OFL leadership programme was co-developed with the Dutch funding agency for science and technical research and has been running for over five years. The programme received very high ratings from past participants.

## Endorsement

Prof. Stefano Stramigioli, chairman of the Robotics and Mechatronics group at the University of Twente, describes the impact as follows:

> The programme is really a unique opportunity for young scientists and professionals to understand their leadership, their relations with themselves and the people they work and collaborate with.

> Thanks to sending people in my group to the OFL and The Recess College, my group is making a radical change and the organisation is becoming stronger and more productive. It is really impressive what this programme is achieving.
