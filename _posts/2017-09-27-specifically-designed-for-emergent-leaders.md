## Our Future Leaders is for young executives and professionals in their early twenties to late thirties

The world of work is contradictory. It sends complex messages of what is required to the fast track entrant and those in the first phases of their career.

Future leaders need to be radical, practical and strategic in knowing what to maintain and what to change from their future positions of power.

They need to know how to develop the necessary qualities of good judgement for handling the unpredictability of the future and the uncertainty of other people's reactions. And to obtain perspective, organisational acumen and a healthy dose of "political savviness" to prosper in today's demanding organisations.

## An intensive, lively and rewarding 7-day programme

The first part of the programme is 5-days and held in the Netherlands. It consists of a real-life laboratory of group and organisational processes and a de-briefing on the personal interaction that happened to you in the laboratory.

It is followed by a 2-day review six weeks later for participants to reflect about how they were best able to transfer their learning to work and home.

## A living lab on organisational life

Participants learn by experiencing the demands of self-leadership and leadership of others in organisations through a real-time simulation of creating high performance teams and an organisation as a whole.

A focused personal de-briefing helps participants recognise what "happened" to them, how their behaviours reflect their personal real-life dilemmas, strengths, patterns and beliefs, with their emotional responses.

## Reviews

Past participants said about the programme:

> I see situations from a different perspective. I'm not trying to make it according to others' ideas and requirements, but trying to find ways according to my own thoughts which is difficult for me.

> I have a higher awareness of the impact I have in groups and how group dynamics happen.

> I'm no longer happy being unhappy ;) That's a tough one to deal with and be consistent in.

> I'm more confident about my capabilities, and I feel empowered. My energy level is much higher than before the course.

> The OFL provides opportunity for real deep change -- when other programmes are usually forgotten in a few weeks.
